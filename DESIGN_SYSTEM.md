# db-ui Design System

## Philosophy

- Components are **controlled by default** for predictability.
- **Design tokens first**: colors, spacing, typography drive all components.
- **Consistency over flexibility**: uniform look and behavior is preferred.
- Components are **reusable and composable**.
- **Accessibility matters**: aim for inclusive UI from the start.
